- `models/` - Saved models for inference.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## üìä Dataset: `matches.csv`
The dataset consists of football match statistics, including:
- **Actual Results** (`actual_x`, `actual_y`)
- **Predictions** (`prediction_x`, `prediction_y`)
- **Teams and Opponents** (`team_x`, `team_y`, `opponent_x`, `opponent_y`)
- **Match Outcome** (`result_x`, `result_y`)
- **Other Features** (`new_team_x`, `new_team_y`)
